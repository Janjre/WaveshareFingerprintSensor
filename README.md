# Waveshare Fingerprint Sensor
A small debuggable library for interacting with [this capacitative fingerprint sensor](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/UART_Fingerprint_Sensor_(C)).
It has been made for an ESP32-S3 but  should work on other things.

Inspired by https://github.com/lbuchs/wv-uart-fingerprint.
